### 1. Python
Please note, this is not meant to be a comprehensive of Python or programming in general.<br>
<h4>This just go through the basic topics in order:</h4><br>

- Data types
    - Numbers
    - Strings
    - Printing 
    - Lists
    - Dictionaries
    - Booleans
    - Tuples
    - Sets
- Comparison Operators
- if,elif,else Statements
- for Loops
- while Loops
- range()
- list comprehension
- function
- lambda expressions
- map and filter
- methods<br><br>

---
### 2. Numpy
- Numpy is a Linear Algebra Library for python, the reason it is so important
for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData
Ecosystem rely on Numpy as one of their main building blocks
- Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries.
- if you have Anaconda, install Numpy by going to your terminal
or command prompt and typing:<br><br>
    ```conda install numpy```<br>
    or<br>
    ```pip install numpy```
    
- Numpy arrays essentially come in two flavors:
    1. vectors 1-d arrays
    2. matrices 2-d arrays
    
- [Numpy Docs](https://numpy.org/)

---
### 3. Pandas
- Pandas is an open source library built on top of Numpy
- It allows for fast analysis and data cleaning and preparation
- It excels in performance and productivity
- It also has built-in visualizaion features
- It can work with data from a wide variety of sources<br>

You'll need to install pandas by going to your command line
or terminal and using either:<br>

```conda install pandas```<br>
or<br>
```pip install pandas```

<h4> Throughout this Tutorial: </h4>

- Series
- DataFrames
- Missing Data
- GroupBy
- Mergin, Joining and Concatenating
- Operations
- Data Input and Output

- [Pandas Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

---
### 4. Matplotlib
- Matplotlib is the most popular plotting library for Python.
- It gives you control over every aspect of a figure.
- It was designed to have a similar feel to MatLab's graphical plotting.
You'll need to install it with pip or conda at your command line or terminal with:

```conda install matplotlib```<br>
or<br>
```pip install matplotlib```
<br>
- [Matplotlib Docs](https://matplotlib.org/)

---
### 5. Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.<br>
You'll need to install it with pip or conda at your command line or terminal with:

```conda install seaborn```<br>
or<br>
```pip install seaborn```
<br>
- [Seaborn Docs](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
